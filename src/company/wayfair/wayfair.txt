what's the most challenging case when having one on one with reports?
    Even the most positive people have bad days, so give your employee the space to vent or decompress if they need to
     Figure out why your employee is frustrated (money, promotion) as you listen, trying to understand
     with empathy & understanding, the other people will be more open to sharing how they relaly feel
     acknowledge what they share with you . echo back what you've heard
     focus on performance  not personality
anything you did do well, if you had chance to do it again ...how could you do it better?

SOLID principal
Class diagrams
● Entity Relationship Diagrams
● API specs
● Sequence diagrams, etc.
Microservice architectures
● Distributed caching
● High availability & resiliency
● Techniques for scaling services and data stores
● Basic HTTP specifications

Additional examples of things we look for:
● Does the candidate show examples of successful partnership with
stakeholders and peers with clear communication?
● Is the candidate flexible in their solutions and open to new ideas? How do they
adapt to new or ambiguous requirements?
Is the candidate able to:
● Get by in from various levels of peers on design and architectural decisions?
● Take suggestions while working through technical challenges?
● Drive change / process improvements when needed?
● Speak in depth about

working in ambiguous situations where you may not have
all the necessary requirements from the starting point and requirements may change over
time; it is in these situations we look for our managers to provide direction and own a game
handling competing priorities and collaboration with
stakeholders


Code Review and We Drive Results
1. In this session you should expect to review a sample of code to diagnose bugs and propose
fixes.
2. You will be asked to review a sample of code in whichever language you choose
(Java, C#, Python).
3. Demonstrate strong communication and problem-solving skills as you work through
the code sample.
4. Within this interview round we are assessing your ability to: navigate bugs in the
sample code, propose fixes to the bugs you detect, and showcase clear
communication.
5. Additionally, we are looking for your ability to avoid code duplication and propose
SOLID principles and design patterns as needed.
