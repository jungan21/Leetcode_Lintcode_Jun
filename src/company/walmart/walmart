6. Internal working of Hashmap.
particular use of some keywords in java .. that help with encapsulation and immutability.
1. Multithreading - async calls
2. Java 8 stream sorting - one liner code
    Arrays.asList(10, 23, -4, 0, 18).stream().sorted().forEach(System.out::println);
    List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(2, 4, 1, 3, 7, 5, 9, 6, 8);

    List<Integer> sortedList = list.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
    List<Integer> sortedList = list.stream().sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder()).collect(Collectors.toList());
(ascending order )List<Integer> sortedList = list.stream().sorted( (i1, i2) -> i1.compareTo(i2) ).collect(Collectors.toList());
(decending order)    List<Integer> sortedList = list.stream().sorted( (i1, i2) -> i2.compareTo(i1) ).collect(Collectors.toList());
3. Java theory like stringbuilder vs stringbuffer,
linkedHashSet vs treeset,
    - LinkedHashSet:  uses LinkedHashMap internally. maintains insertion order of elements
    - TreeSet: use TreeMap TreeSet orders the elements according to supplied Comparator. If no comparator is supplied, elements will be placed in their natural ascending order.
