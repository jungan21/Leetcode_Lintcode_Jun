13. Given an unsorted array of arbitary integer. define a sequence as numerically-consecutive number (e.g. 1, 2,3, 4, 5 is a sequence)
Find the length of the longest sequence oin the array. Note that the numerically consequtive sequence need not be consecutive in the array
(e.g. 3, 4, 3, 5, 1, is a seuqnce of length 5). Perform this task in O(n) time.
